This is Jobsity Data Engineering Challenge
#### Assumptions
Below are some of the assumptions for this demostration

  1.	The data format remains the same for the various data points
  2. 	The data is data cleaning and thus there is no need for data cleaning processes (for this demonstration purpose).
  3.	Each URL represents a unique set of data.
  4.	A file is loaded per time i.e. one file is processed at a time.


#### Requirements


#### Configuration and Setup


#### Steps to execute data ingestion and data processing


#### Weekly Average Reports


#### Data Ingestion Status
