# JobsityDEChallenge
This is Jobsity Data Engineering Challenge
#### Assumptions
Below are some of the assumptions for this demostration

  1.	The data format remains the same for the various data points
  2. 	The data is data cleaning and thus there is no need for data cleaning processes (for this demonstration purpose).
  3.	Each URL represents a unique set of data.
  4.	A file is loaded per time i.e. one file is processed at a time.


#### Requirements
  1. MySQL database
  2. Python 3.8 or higher version
  3. Python libraries
      - pandas (pip install pandas)
      - configparser (pip install configparser)
      - sqlalchemy (pip install sqlalchemy)
      - mysql (pip install mysql)
      - dask (pip install dask)


#### Configuration and Setup
Once the database and the python environments are ready, do the following:
1. Download the trips directory into the C drive (or any other drive as the root of the demo)
2. Open the configuration file (settings.ini) and input the database connection details in the [Database] section. See examples below
      - hostname=localhost 
      - database=jobsity
      - username=root
      - password=ppppp
